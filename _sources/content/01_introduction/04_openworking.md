| 1 | Open Access        | A conference paper of this work was presented at the OR Society Simulation Workshop 2023 [https://www.theorsociety.com/media/7313/doiorg1036819sw23030.pdf](https://www.theorsociety.com/media/7313/doiorg1036819sw23030.pdf)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2 | Open Artifacts     | <ul><li>All research artifacts including this website are archived permanently at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10054063)</li><li>Production code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-simpy-example-docs)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3 | Open Model         | <ul><li>The model has been developed using Free and open simulation software;</li> <li>All mode code is reusable and adaptable under the permissive MIT license model;</li><li>The model is documented in detail within a online Jupyter Book;</li><li>Additional documentation organised by the [STRESS-DES checklist](../03_stress/01_objectives.md) within the Jupyter Book.</li></ul> |
| 4 | Open Environment   | A [docker image is available via dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tommonks01/treat_sim) to enable replication of the OS and software environment and model execution on a local machine.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5 | Open Infrastucture | The model can be run online using BinderHub or Thebe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
